Functionality Completed (F)

D- A user should sign in by submitting her/his username. The server checks if username is available.

D- Once signed in, the user receives the list of online users. To start a conversation or join an existing one, the user selects one other active user from this list.

D- The user interface should consist of at least two windows (or panels): one with the list of active users and a second showing the messages of the active conversation. In the latter window, a text box allows the user to submit her/his message in the conversion.

D- Once a conversation has started, other users may join by selecting one of the users already chatting.

D- You may consider limiting the number of participants per conversation (e.g., 5
active users). Each user should join one conversation at a time.

D- You may also consider additional feature such as a private messaging function
(two users may start a private conversation in a dedicated window)
